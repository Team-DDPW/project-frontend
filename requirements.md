# Software Requirements

## Vision

Our vision is to create an app where packages can be sent to countries that lack accessible and affordable shipping methods. This app will assist in finding people traveling to desired destinations to ship apackage in a much more effective, efficient and faster way than current traditional options. It helps communities that lack options many of us take for granted on a daily basis.

## Scope (In/Out)

IN

- Allows users to post a package send request
- It lists all package send requests so travelers can identify a package that needs to be shipped to their destination
- It allows a traveler to make contact with the package send requester
- It allows travelers to get rewarded for the help (Gig economy)

OUT

- Our app will not become a social media platform
- Packages will be sent at users discretion

## MVP

- Create profile for users
- CRUD functionality for request post
- Email functionality between traveler and requester
- Image upload for packages

## Stretch

- Add chat feature in lieu of email

## Functional Requirements

1. An admin can create and delete user accounts
2. A user can update their profile information
3. A user can search for all destinations and posts

## Data Flow
