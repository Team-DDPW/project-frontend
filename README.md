## Problem Domain

In 2021 there are still regions of the world where standardized shipping is not practical, cost effective or even possible. People currently use friends/family/acquaintances to carry important documents and items. This has become a more reliable and cost effective means.

## Project Summary

Our vision was to create an app where packages can be sent to countries that lack accessible and affordable shipping methods. This app will assist in finding people traveling to desired destinations to ship apackage in a much more effective, efficient and faster way than current traditional options. It helps communities that lack options many of us take for granted on a daily basis.
